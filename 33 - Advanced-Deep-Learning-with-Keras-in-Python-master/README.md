# Advanced Deep Learning with Keras in Python

The data analysis is documented in [Advanced_Deep_Learning_with_Keras_in_Python.ipynb](https://github.com/iDataist/Advanced-Deep-Learning-with-Keras-in-Python/blob/master/Advanced_Deep_Learning_with_Keras_in_Python.ipynb). The lecture notes and the raw data files are also stored in the repository. The summary of the content is shown below:

- The Keras Functional API

- Two Input Networks Using Categorical Embeddings, Shared Layers, and Merge Layers

- Multiple Inputs: 3 Inputs (and Beyond!)

- Multiple Outputs
